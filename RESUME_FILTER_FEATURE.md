# Global Resume Filter Chat Feature ü§ñ

## Overview
Added an AI-powered chat assistant for recruiters to intelligently filter job applicants **across ALL jobs** based on natural language requirements. The chat icon appears on the Companies page and searches through all applications from all job postings.

## Features

### 1. **Floating Chat Icon** 
- Appears in the bottom-right corner on the **Companies page** (`/admin/companies`)
- Clean, modern design with teal color scheme
- Animated with pulse effect and "AI" badge
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Searches across ALL job postings

### 2. **Natural Language Filtering**
Recruiters can type requirements in plain English:
- "Java experience 5 years"
- "JavaScript fresher" 
- "Python and React skills"
- "MBA graduate with 2+ years experience"

### 3. **Smart Resume Parsing**
The backend intelligently:
- Extracts skills from user profiles and bios
- Parses experience years (handles "5+ years", "5 yr", etc.)
- Identifies freshers (0-1 year experience)
- Matches technology keywords
- Provides flexible matching (¬±1 year for experience)

### 4. **Global Search with Results Page**
- Searches across ALL job postings simultaneously
- Shows results in a dedicated filtered candidates page
- Displays matching jobs, total stats, and candidate details
- Export results to CSV functionality
- Contact information and resume links readily available

## API Endpoint

### POST `/api/v1/application/filter-resumes`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "jobId": "65f4b3c2d1234567890abcde",
  "requirement": "Java experience 5 years"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Found 3 matching candidates",
  "filteredApplicants": [...],
  "totalApplicants": 15,
  "success": true
}
```

## Filtering Logic

### 1. **Fresher Detection**
Keywords: `fresher`, `0 year`, `no experience`, `entry level`, `graduate`
- Matches candidates with 0-1 years experience

### 2. **Experience Matching**
- Extracts numbers from requirement
- Parses experience from candidate bio
- Allows ¬±1 year flexibility

### 3. **Skill Matching**
- Extracts technology/skill keywords
- Matches against candidate skills array
- Checks bio for additional mentions

### 4. **Combined Filtering**
- Must match BOTH skill AND experience (if specified)
- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles various formats ("5 years", "5+ years", "5yr")

## Examples

### Example 1: Fresher Search
**Input:** "JavaScript fresher"
**Matches:**
- Candidates with "fresher" in bio
- Candidates with 0-1 year experience
- Having JavaScript in skills

### Example 2: Experienced Developer
**Input:** "Python developer 5 years"
**Matches:**
- Candidates with "Python" in skills
- Having 4-6 years experience (¬±1 year)

### Example 3: Multiple Skills
**Input:** "React and Node.js 3 years"
**Matches:**
- Candidates with both React and Node.js
- Having 2-4 years experience

## UI Components

### Chat Window
